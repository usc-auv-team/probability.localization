# For now write a function to generate mock data

# Hardcode actual distance of obstacles

# Calculate difference between computer vision + IMU vector and hardcoded vector

# Algorithm for next step

# Output - Relative location of the Observed Object, in the format of Angles, distance and probability (x,y,z), d,  p
