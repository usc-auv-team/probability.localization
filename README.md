# Receive input from IMU - A 3d vector. (x,y,z) which is an absolute vector of the distance traveled from the calibrated point (0,0,0)
# For now write a function to generate mock data

# Receive computer vision data - Computer Vision Data: 3d Vector that includes the angles of the objectâ€™s center from the AUV, the distance and probability, e.g. (x,y,z), d, p
# For now write a function to generate mock data

# Code logic here

# Output - Relative location of the Observed Object, in the format of Angles, distance and probability (x,y,z), d,  p
